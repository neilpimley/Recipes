A personal sample application for an intweview process

Backend using EF6 and WebApi2. I created the DataBase inthe VisualStudio editor so it is misisng foreign keys and indexes which I would normally add if I was creating a "rel" DB.

I've used JsonWebTokens for securiuty using auth0 to generate tokens but on an internal system I'd create a security service to generate my own. Just use the google link to login.
