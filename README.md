A personal sample application for an intweview process

Backend using EF6 and WebApi2. I created the DB in VS so it is misisng foreign keys and indexes but would add them if I was creating a proper DB.

I used auth0 to generate tokens but on an internal system I'd create a security service to generate my own.
